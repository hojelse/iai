### 1 a

csp = {
  X = { x1, x2, x3, x4 },
  D = { [1..6], [1..6], [1..6], [1..6] },
  C = {
    x1 != x2,
    x1 != x3,
    x1 != x4,
    x2 != x3,
    x2 != x4,
    x3 != x4,
    x1 != 1,
    x2 != 2,
    x3 != 3,
    x4 != 4,
    x3 <= 5,
    x4 > 4,
    x4 - x3 > 2,
    x3 + x1 >= 5,
    x1 * x2 >= 6,
    x1 + x2 <= 7,
  }
}

#### Backtracking search tree (line by line)
x1 -> x2
  (1, ) nope, breaks: x1 != 1
  (2,1) nope, breaks: x1 * x2 >= 6
  (2,2) nope, breaks: x1 != x2
  (2,3)
x2 -> x3
  (3,1)
x3 -> x4
  (1,1) nope, breaks: x4 > 4
  (1,2) nope, breaks: x4 > 4
  (1,3) nope, breaks: x4 > 4
  (1,4) nope, breaks: x4 > 4
  (1,5)

Solution: x1=2, x2=3, x3=1, x4=5
