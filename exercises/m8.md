# Mandatory assignment 8 (exercises11.pdf)

Consider the LP problem of maximizing `−2*x1 + 3*x2` over the feasible area shown below:

![graph](./md-imgs/graph-exercises11.png)

## 1. Write the LP problem on standard form.
Linear functions:
```
x2 = x1 + 3
x2 = (1/2)x1 + 4
x2 = (1/4)x1 - 1
```

LP problem on standard form:

Maximize: `(−2)x1 + (3)x2`

Subject to:
```
     -x1 + x2  <=  3
-(1/2)x1 + x2  <=  4
 (1/4)x1 - x2  <=  1
        x1,x2  >=  0
```

## 2. Write the LP problem on slack form.

Maximize: `z`

Subject to
```
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)x2
```

`x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 >= 0`


## 3. By using you answer to 2. as an initial dictionary...
### 3.a. Write the dictionaries computed by the simplex algorithm,
```
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)x2
```
```
x2 = 3 +       x1 -    x3
x4 = 1 -  (1/2)x1 +    x3
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)x1 -    x3
z  = 9 +       x1 - (3)x3
```
```
x1 = 2   +   (2)x3 -   (2)x4
x2 = 5   +      x3 -   (2)x4
x5 = 1/2 - (7/2)x3 + (5/2)x4
z  = 11  -      x3 -   (2)x4
```

### 3.b. Indicate the corner points associated with each dictionary.

(0,0), (0,3), (2,5)

## 4. What is the optimal solution returned by simplex?

x1=2 and x2=5

## 5. Use the figure to answer the following questions:
### 5.a. Is there an optimal solution for maximizing `x1 - 5 * x2` over the feasible area, and if so where?

Yes (4,0)

### 5.b. Is there an optimal solution for maximing `3 * x1 + x2` over the feasible area, and if so where?

No, beacuse it's but unbounded.

The maximum value is point along the contraint `x2 = (1/4)x1 - 1` where `x1` is infinitly big. So the limit as `x1 -> inf` for `x2 = (1/4)x1 - 1`.

## Appendix

### Full working out of question 3:
1. Compute the dictionary of an initial solution

```
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)x2
```

2. Choose a variable xi with positive coefficient in objective expression (entering variable or pivot column)

Entering variable: `x2`

3. Calculate its maximum increase given that all basic variables must remain non- negative
```
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2  =>  x2 <= 3
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2  =>  x2 <= 4
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2  =>  x2 <= infinite
```
Max increase: 3

4. Choose an equation for a basic variable xj that becomes zero when xi is increased (leaving variable or pivot row)

Leaving variable: `x3`

5. Solve it with respect to xi

`x3 = 3 + x1 - x2  <=>  x2 = 3 + x1 - x3`

6. Substitute this new expression for xi in remaining basic variable expressions in dictionary and in z expression

```
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    (3 + x1 - x3)
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    (3 + x1 - x3)
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)(3 + x1 - x3)

=>

x2 = 3 +       x1 -    x3
x4 = 1 -  (1/2)x1 +    x3
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)x1 -    x3
z  = 9 +       x1 - (3)x3
```

7. Stop if resulting dictionary is optimal (no variable coefficients in z are positive), otherwise goto step 2

```
x2 = 3 +       x1 -    x3
x4 = 1 -  (1/2)x1 +    x3
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)x1 -    x3
z  = 9 +       x1 - (3)x3
```

Entering variable: `x1`

```
x2 = 3 +       x1 -    x3  =>  x1 <= infinite
x4 = 1 -  (1/2)x1 +    x3  =>  x1 <= 2
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)x1 -    x3  =>  x1 <= 3.2
```

Max increase: 2

Leaving variable: `x4`

`x4 = 1 - (1/2)x1 + x3  <=> x1 = 2 + (2)x3 - (2)x4`

```
x1 = 2 + (2)x3 - (2)x4
x2 = 3 +       (2 + (2)x3 - (2)x4) -    x3
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)(2 + (2)x3 - (2)x4) -    x3
z  = 9 +       (2 + (2)x3 - (2)x4) - (3)x3

=>

x1 = 2   +   (2)x3 -   (2)x4
x2 = 5   +      x3 -   (2)x4
x5 = 1/2 - (7/2)x3 + (5/2)x4
z  = 11  -      x3 -   (2)x4
```
