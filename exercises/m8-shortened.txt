# Mandatory assignment 8 (exercises11.pdf)

## 1

Maximize: (âˆ’2)x1 + (3)x2

Subject to:
     -x1 + x2  <=  3
-(1/2)x1 + x2  <=  4
 (1/4)x1 - x2  <=  1
        x1,x2  >=  0

## 2

Maximize: z

Subject to:
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)x2
x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 >= 0

## 3.
### 3.a.

Initial dictionary:
x3 = 3 +       x1 -    x2
x4 = 4 +  (1/2)x1 -    x2
x5 = 1 -  (1/4)x1 +    x2
z  =   -    (2)x1 + (3)x2

Dictionary after interation 1:
x2 = 3 +       x1 -    x3
x4 = 1 -  (1/2)x1 +    x3
x5 = 4 -  (5/4)x1 -    x3
z  = 9 +       x1 - (3)x3

Dictionary after interation 2:
x1 = 2   +   (2)x3 -   (2)x4
x2 = 5   +      x3 -   (2)x4
x5 = 1/2 - (7/2)x3 + (5/2)x4
z  = 11  -      x3 -   (2)x4

### 3.b.

Initial point: (0,0)
Point after interation 1: (0,3)
Point after interation 2: (2,5)

## 4.

x1=2 and x2=5

## 5.
### 5.a.

Yes (4,0)

### 5.b.

No, beacuse it's but unbounded.

The maximum value is point along the contraint `x2 = (1/4)x1 - 1` where `x1` is infinitly big. So the limit as `x1 -> inf` for `x2 = (1/4)x1 - 1`.
