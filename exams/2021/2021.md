### 1.a

To prove: `d(v,g) >= d(v,l) - d(g,l)`
Triangle inequality: `d(v,g) + d(g,l) >= d(v, l)`.

```
         d(v,g) + d(g,l)  >=  d(v,l)
d(v,g) + d(g,l) - d(g,l)  >=  d(v,l) - d(g,l)   [ if a >= b then a-c >= b-c ]
                  d(v,g)  >=  d(v,l) - d(g,l)   [ simplify ]
```

### 1.b.

Definition: `h(v) = max_{l in L}{d(v, l) − d(g, l)}`
To prove: `h(g) = 0`

```
h(g) = max_{l in L}{d(g, l) − d(g, l)}   
h(g) = max_{l in L}{d(g, l) − d(g, l)}   [ set v equal to g ]
h(g) = max_{l in L}{0}                   [ simplify ]
h(g) = 0                                 [ output of max function is not dependent on l, so simplify]
```

### 1.c.

To prove: `exist v,g . forall l in L . d(v, l) − d(g, l) < 0`

`v` can in some cases be closer to `g` than any other point `l`.

### 1.d.

To prove: `h(v) <= d(v, g)` (Admissibility)
Definition: `h(v) = max_{l in L}{d(v, l) − d(g, l)}`
Triangle inequality: `d(v,g) + d(g,l) >= d(v, l)` or as shown in 1.a. `d(v,g) >= d(v,l) - d(g,l)`

```
             d(v, l) − d(g, l)   <=  d(v, g)
max_{l in L}{d(v, l) − d(g, l)}  <=  d(v, g)   [ if it holds for any l, then it holds for the max l aswell ]
                           h(v)  <=  d(v, g)   [ substitude in from definition ]
```

### 1.e.

h_SLD, straight line distance will probably underestimate a lot for most graphs.

h, landmarks are based on actual paths in the graph, and will probably underestimate less.

Therefore i think h with landmarks will be stronger. (the time penalty being the one-time pre-computation)

Prove: True IFF x === x

Using fig. 7.11 of Russell

```
x  ===  True <=> x
x  ===  ((True => x) AND (x => True))            [biconditional elimination]
x  ===  ((NOT True OR x) AND ((NOT x) OR True))  [implication elimination]
x  ===  ((False OR x) AND ((NOT x) OR True))     [NOT True === False]
x  ===  (False OR x) AND True                    [x OR True === True]
x  ===  x AND True                               [x OR False === x]
x  ===  x                                        [x AND True === x]
```

Prove: False IFF x === NOT x

```
NOT x  ===  False IFF x
NOT x  ===  ((False => x) AND (x => False))               [biconditional elimination]
NOT x  ===  (((NOT False) OR x) AND ((NOT x) OR False))   [implication elimination]
NOT x  ===  ((True OR x) AND ((NOT x) OR False))          [NOT False === True]
NOT x  ===  (True AND ((NOT x) OR False))                 [x OR True === True]
NOT x  ===  (True AND (NOT x))                            [x OR False === x]
NOT x  ===  NOT x                                         [x AND True === x]

```

### 3.e.

((x1 IFF True) AND (x2 XOR True) AND (x3 IFF False)) OR
((x1 IFF True) AND (x2 IFF True) AND (x3 XOR False))

[h1: x IFF True === x]

((x1 XOR True) AND x2            AND (x3 IFF False)) OR
(x1            AND (x2 XOR True) AND (x3 IFF False)) OR

(NOT x1 AND     x2 AND NOT x3) OR
(    x1 AND NOT x2 AND NOT x3) OR
(    x1 AND     x2 AND (x3 XOR False))

[h4: x XOR False === x]

(NOT x1 AND     x2 AND NOT x3) OR
(    x1 AND NOT x2 AND NOT x3) OR
(    x1 AND     x2 AND     x3)
```

3 options for the secret code:
WHITE BLACK WHITE,
BLACK WHITE WHITE,
BLACK BLACK BLACK

### 3.f.

Creating a disjunction of every path from x1 to the terminal 1:

(NOT x1 AND x2 AND NOT x3) OR (x1 AND NOT x2 AND NOT x3) OR (x1 AND x2 AND x3)

This expression is literally the same as E[True/y1, True/y2, False/y3] by definition. Therefore they are also logically equivalent.

### 3.g.

The feedback tells us that there is correct number of black and white pegs in the guess, but the permutation is wrong in two places and correct in one place.

The 2 other permutations are:

BLACK WHITE WHITE,
WHITE WHITE BLACK

### 3.h.

(x1     AND NOT x2 AND NOT x3) OR
(NOT x1 AND NOT x2 AND     x3)
