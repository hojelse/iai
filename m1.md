## Mandatory Assignment 1
### a
```
f(n) = (1-1)g(n)+1*h(n)
<=> f(n) = h(n)
```

Corresponds to Greedy best first search

```
f(n) = (1-0.5)g(n)+0.5h(n)
<=> 0.5*g(n) + 0.5*h(n)
```

Corresponds to A* search

### b
`h` is admissible,
implies unweigthed A* is admissible,
implies weigthed A* with `w=0.5` is admissible.

Any value of `w` will only underestimate more,
implies at least `w=[0;0.5]` is admissible.

We have no additional information about `h` other than `h` is admissible,
therefore we can't guarantee admissiblility for higher than equal weighing.
